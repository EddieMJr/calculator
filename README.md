# calculator

This is a project that has us create a calculator using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

I used HTML to create the buttons and screen(I used paragraph tags).
I used CSS to add color to the screen and form to the calculator (I used grid for the rows of buttons on the calculator).
I used JS to make sure the calculator actually worked (I made 3 contstants, 3 functions & used an if statement and "Try...Catch" in the third to catch errors & syntax errors).
